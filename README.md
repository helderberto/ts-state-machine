# TypeScript State Machine

This repository is dedicated to my studies on State Machines.

## Goals

- Learn the fundamentals of state machines
- Implement various examples in practice
- Explore patterns and best practices

## Fundamental Concepts

A State Machine is composed of:

- **States**: Finite representations of a condition
- **Events**: Triggers that causes transitions
- **Transitions**: Switching from one state to another
- **Context**: Additional data kept by the machine
- **Actions**: Side effects that occur during a transition
